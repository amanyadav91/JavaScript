**Learning JavaScript Basics**

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my journey of learning JavaScript with basic concepts. This repository is aimed at beginners who are looking to dive into the world of JavaScript programming. Whether you're a complete novice or have some experience with programming, I hope you find the resources here helpful in understanding the fundamental concepts of JavaScript.

### Installation Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: You need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: While you can use any text editor or IDE for writing JavaScript code, I recommend using Visual Studio Code for its robust features and excellent support for JavaScript development. You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Running JavaScript Files

To run the JavaScript files provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code by pressing `Ctrl + ` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + ` (Mac).

2. Navigate to the directory containing the JavaScript file you want to run using the `cd` command.

3. Once you're in the correct directory, run the JavaScript file using the following command:

    ```
    node filename.js
    ```

    Replace `filename.js` with the name of the JavaScript file you want to execute.

### Code Formatting with Prettier

For code formatting, I recommend using Prettier. You can install Prettier via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or directly in your project.

To install Prettier using CDN, add the following `<script>` tag in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/prettier@2.5.1/bin-prettier.js"></script>
```

With Prettier installed, you can format your JavaScript code by running the following command in the terminal:

```
node_modules/.bin/prettier --write filename.js
```

Replace `filename.js` with the name of the JavaScript file you want to format.
